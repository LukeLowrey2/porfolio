                    A Little About Me
                </h3>
                <p >
                I am a Fullstack Academy graduate pivoting into the tech field. In recent years I’ve worked in graphic design, media production, and marketing. Now I’m excited for a future in web development.

                Throughout my life I’ve found joy and magic when creating or editing websites with code. Whether it be making my Myspace page fit my ever-changing personality as a kid, expanding my knowledge of design and responsiveness in my Interactive Media Program, or building a graphic design portfolio to show off my work. I always found coding to be spectacular and rewarding. After learning the tools to create functionality between the front and back end of an application, I’m excited to see where my future will take me: a future geared toward helping and expanding my community and the world through web development.

                In my spare time you can find me expanding my skills with research, sketching, making digital art, going to live shows, or playing Nintendo.
